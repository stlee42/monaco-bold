# Monaco Bold

_The Monaco font with a bold variant_

vjpr's originals had the italic and bold italic in a separate folder and were not usable as an integrated family that had all four styles (regular, italic, bold, and bold italic).

I have combined them into complete families.

## The Fonts

- MonacoB has bold style that is bold (20% transform).
- MonacoBSemi has bold style that is bolder (30% transform).
- MonacoB2 has bold style that is boldest (40% transform).
