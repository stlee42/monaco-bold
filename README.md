# Monaco Bold

_The Monaco font with a bold variant_

vjpr's originals had the italic and bold italic in a separate folder and were not usable as an integrated family that had all four fonts (regular, italic, bold, and bold italic).

I have combined them into complete families.

## The Fonts

- MonacoB - bold (20% transform)
- MonacoBSemi - bolder (30% transform)
- MonacoB2 - boldest (40% transform)
